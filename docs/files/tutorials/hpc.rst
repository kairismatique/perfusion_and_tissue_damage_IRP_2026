The code can be run in two version: serial or parallel. In order to run in parallel, you can either use your local
machine by following this tutorial: `Running on a local machine <local.html>`_. You can also choose to use one of the supercomputer facilities that allow to run
the simulation using high performance computing (HPC). The three facilities that support the project are Crescent2,
Archer2 and Ares. More information about those three facilities are given below, abd tutorial on how to set up the
environment for each one of them.

**Crescent2**

Crescent2 is a Cranfield University facility available to students and researchers.
It consists of 89 compute nodes, each equipped with:

* Dual-socket Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPUs (2 sockets per node);
* 16 CPU cores (total) per node, with 16 threads;
* 128 GB of memory per node;
* InfiniBand EDR interconnect for high-speed data transfer;
* Operating system: Linux – Red Hat 8.4.

Each user can access up to 96 cores simultaneously.

**Archer2**

ARCHER2 is the UK's National Supercomputing Service, provided by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), EPCC at the
University of Edinburgh, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Cray.
Deployed in 2020, the supercomputer counts 5,860 compute nodes each equipped with dual AMD EPYC Zen2 (Rome) 64-core CPUs
at 2.25GHz.

It possesses 750,080 computing cores and a cooling system. It boasts a theoretical peak performance of 28 PetaFlops.

A full tutorial will be available soon.

**Ares**

Ares is a Polish system part of the PLGrid Consortium which access has been given to GEMINI researchers. Deployed in
2021, the supercomputer is based on computing servers with Intel Xeon Platinum and Intel Xeon Gold processors,
divided into three groups:

* 532 servers each equipped with 192 GB of RAM,
* 256 servers each equipped with 384 GB of RAM each,
* 9 servers with 8 NVIDIA Tesla V100 cards each.

It possesses 37 824 computing cores and a cooling system. It boasts a theoretical peak performance of over 3.5 PetaFlops
for its CPU parts and over 500 TeraFlops for its GPU parts.
