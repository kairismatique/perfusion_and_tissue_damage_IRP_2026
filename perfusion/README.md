# State of the branch

This folder is currently in a refactoring phase.

The [Legacy_version](src/Legacy_version) folder is almost completely refactored. 
The files have been moved in the correct folders and functions have been created for the long scripts to create 
modularity and introduce separation of concerns. 

A modernisation from FEniCS Legacy to FEniCS-X has been initiated in the [X_version](src/X_version) folder. 
Most of the files have not been updates. The only simulation migrated is the 
[permeability_initialiser.py](src/X_version/simulation/permeability_initialiser.py) and the corresponding functions. 

A testing effort have been started in the [test](test) folder. A fixture, representing a mesh of a cube rotated on 
itself, has been created to this purpose. Some initial tests have been produced for the 
[finite_element_fcts.py](src/Legacy_version/utils/finite_element_fcts.py) of the Legacy version in the [test](test) folder.

The documentation has been enhanced in the [docs](../docs) folder.

# Getting started

You can either run the code on your local machine, or in a HPC systems. For more information, please see [the HPC page](hpc_submission/README.md).

If you have Apptainer installed - also named Singularity - you can build a container image using the following command. 

```bash
apptainer build containers/container.sif containers/container.def
```

However, if you don't have it installed, you can also run it locally on your machine. 
We recommend having a Linux machine to run it. If you own a Windows machine, you can install a Linux one with wsl. 
Please follow the link to install wsl if you do not have it: [Installing wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

You need to have a conda environment installed on your Linux environment. 
If you don’t possess one, please enter the following commands to install Miniconda. 
The required version of python is 3.9.

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

After installing the package manager you need to activate conda and create a custom environment to run your code on.
You can create the environment with the following command. 

````bash
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda create -n fenics-legacy -c conda-forge fenics python=3.9
conda activate fenics-legacy
````

**Remember to activate both conda and fenics-env everytime you want to use the code**

The requirements need to be installed as well into your conda environment. Use the following command to do so.

````bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

The brain meshes are compressed in a .zip file. Before running the code, you will need to extract those. 
Use the following command.

````bash
tar xf ../brain_meshes.tar.xz
````

The perfusion_runner.sh needs to be set as an executable file for it to run successfully.
More information about what the perfusion_runner.sh does can be found in the [Main pipeline section](#main-pipeline).

````bash
cd ~/perfusion_and_tissue_damage/perfusion/
chmod +x perfusion_runner.sh
./perfusion_runner.sh
````

# Pipeline
## Initialisation tasks

To be able to run the main pipeline, some preliminary tasks need to be carried out.
The following tasks only need to be run once: 

1. **Extract the brain meshes**:

- Unpack `brain_meshes.tar.xz` into the project directory.
- This command only need to be run once.
- You can use the following command if necessary:

```
tar xf ../brain_meshes.tar.xz
```

2. **Initialise the permeability tensor**:

- Run `permeability_initialiser.py` to compute the permeability tensor.
- This simulation only need to be run once.
- You can use the following command to run it in parallel from the project directory:

```
mpirun -n 4 python3 -m src.Legacy_version.simulation.permeability_initialiser --config_file ./configs/config_permeability_initialiser.yaml
```

- Uses `config_permeability_initialiser.yaml` as a configuration file. It contains information about the mesh file, the output folder or physical parameters such as the arteriole/venule permeability tensor form.
- This simulation will take up to 5 min with 4 cores, depending of the environment you are using (HPC systems, local). More information about the performance can be found here: `Performance <performance.html>`_.

When those task have been done, the main pipeline can be performed. 

## Main pipeline

1. **Create boundary conditions**:

- Generate boundary conditions for all scenarios, but especially occluded scenarios (e.g., LMCAo, RMCAo):
- You can use the following command to run it in serial from the project directory:

````bash
python3 -m src.Legacy_version.simulation.BC_creator --config_file ./configs/config_basic_flow_solver.yaml
````

- The command presented here is adapted to a healthy case. To adapt it to an occluded case, please update the argument of the command.
- Update `config_basic_flow_solver.yaml` to point to the generated boundary conditions file and change the output folder to avoid overwriting.
- In the *.csv summarising the boundary conditions the cortical surface regions are numbered so that:
    - 21 - left ACA
    - 22 - left MCA
    - 23 - left PCA
    - 24 - right ACA
    - 25 - right MCA
    - 26 - right PCA

2. **Solve Flow**:

- Run `basic_flow_solver.py` for pressure and velocity fields.
- You can use the following command to run it in parallel from the project directory:

````bash
mpirun -n 4 python3 -m src.Legacy_version.simulation.basic_flow_solver --config_file ./configs/config_basic_flow_solver.yaml
````

- Uses `config_basic_flow_solver.yaml` as a configuration file. It contains information about the input and outputs files and folders, about physical, simulation and optimisation parameters.
- This simulation will take up to 6 min with 4 cores, depending of the environment you are using (HPC systems, local). More information about the performance can be found here: `Performance <performance.html>`_.
- The simulation has already three different cases supported: a healthy brain, a LMCAo and a RMCAo case. Three configurations files are available.:
    - ``config_basic_flow_solver.yaml``
    - ``config_basic_flow_solver_LMCAo.yaml``
    - ``config_basic_flow_solver_RMCAo.yaml``

## Additional simulations


Additional results can be produced using the following simulations, after the main pipeline have been produced one.

1. **Convert the finite element results to a NIFTI format**:

- Run `convert_res2img.py` to convert a ``.h5`` or ``.xdmf`` to a ``.nii.gz`` format.
- You can use the following command to do so:

````bash
python3 -m src.Legacy_version.io.convert_res2img --config_file ./results/p0000/perfusion_healthy/settings.yaml
````

- Use the configuration file of the results you want to convert. Three files are available, once the main pipeline has been run for the three cases (healthy, LMCAo, RMCAo):
    - ``./results/p0000/perfusion_healthy/settings.yaml``
    - ``./results/p0000/perfusion_LMCAo/settings.yaml``
    - ``./results/p0000/perfusion_RMCAo/settings.yaml``

2. **Compute lesion volume proxies from brain perfusion images**:

- Run `lesion_comp_from_img.py` to compute the lesion volume proxies form a healthy and occluded brain perfusion images.
- Use the following command to run it in serial from the project directory:

````bash
python3 -m src.Legacy_version.simulation.lesion_comp_from_img --healthy_file ./results/p0000/perfusion_healthy/perfusion.nii.gz --occluded_file ./results/p0000/perfusion_RMCAo/perfusion.nii.gz
````

- Use the healthy and occluded images you want to test. The inputted files should be in the NIFTI format (``.nii.gz``).

3. **Compute infarct volumes across a range of perfusion thresholds**:

- Run `infarct_calculation_thresholds.py` to compute infarct volumes across a range of perfusion thresholds.
- Use the following command to run it in parallel from the project directory:

````bash
mpirun -n 4 python3 -m src.Legacy_version.simulation.infarct_calculation_thresholds --config_file ./configs/config_basic_flow_solver_RMCAo.yaml --baseline ./results/p0000/perfusion_healthy/perfusion.xdmf --occluded ./results/p0000/perfusion_RMCAo/perfusion.xdmf
````

- Use the configuration file of the results you want to convert. Three files are available, once the main pipeline has been run for the three cases (healthy, LMCAo, RMCAo):
    - ``./results/p0000/perfusion_healthy/settings.yaml``;
    - ``./results/p0000/perfusion_LMCAo/settings.yaml``;
    - ``./results/p0000/perfusion_RMCAo/settings.yaml``.
- Adapt the occluded file to the configuration you have chosen.
